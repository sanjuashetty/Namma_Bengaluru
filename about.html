    <h2>Welcome to My Trip Log!</h2>
    <p>Whether you're a local or a visitor, the city offers a unique blend of history, culture, tech, and tradition. Its old-world charm lives in places like the Bangalore Palace, Tipu Sultan‚Äôs Fort, and Bull Temple, while its modern vibe thrives in bustling cafes, art galleries, and tech parks.
      This page is all about my personal experiences exploring the vibrant and lively city of Bengaluru, also known as Bangalore. From majestic palaces and serene gardens to thrilling amusement parks and spiritual getaways ‚Äî Bengaluru has something for everyone!

    <p>
      I've created this project to share beautiful places, peaceful moments, and unforgettable memories with you all. Each spot has its own charm, and I hope my collection inspires you to explore, appreciate, and love the city as much as I do.
